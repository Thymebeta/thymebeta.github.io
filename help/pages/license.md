Your work is important to us - our site exists for the sole purpose of allowing
you to share it, so we offer the option to license your work and protect it.

We currently offer two license choices:
* `No License`
* `Creative Commons CC BY`

## No License
Your work will have no license. This means it is unprotected, but who really cares?
Not me; I'm just the front end developer.
