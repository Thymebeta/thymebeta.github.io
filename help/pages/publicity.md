All videos on Thyme are uploaded under one of three categories: `Public`,
`Link Only`, or `Private`.

**`Public`** quite literally means that. Your video can come up on internal and
external search results and anyone can watch it. Once you click `Post`, anyone
will be able to access your video. Chances are, this is the option you want.

**`Link Only`** videos will not come up on search results, however they can
still be viewed by anyone. Instead of finding the video through search, viewers
must be provided with a direct link to the video. If you've made a video that
you only want to share with a few people or that you plan to embed onto an
external site, this is probably the option for you.

Finally, **`Private`** videos are only viewable by you. As soon as you log out,
you will no longer have access to the video until you log back in. Even when
provided with the direct link to the video, no one will be able to watch it.
This is probably what you'll want if you're using Thyme to store a video for a
personal project or if you want to finish up a few things before making it
public.

A video's publicity settings can be changed at any time, so a video previously
made public can be hidden from view, and vice-versa.
